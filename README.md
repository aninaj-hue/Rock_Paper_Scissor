# Rock_Paper_Scissor
I will ask the user to select either rock, paper or scrissors. And I will also make the computer choose one put of three randomly.
Now I will check who won the game and give them a score. This is done 5 times to say who has won finally and I will ask the user if they want to continue or exit the game.
